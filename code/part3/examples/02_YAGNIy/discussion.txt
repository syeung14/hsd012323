You Aren't Gonna Need It (yet)

It it can be postponed to a later time, then postpone decisions
until we have more information to make better decisions.

Last responsible moment

Avoid any work that is not really needed or necessary.

Don't write more code with extensibility in mind when it is not
the right set of features to anticipate.

Relevance and necessity should rule our decisions, not technology
features, perceived extensibility, or infatuation.
