DRY

Don't Repeat Yourself

Every piece of knowledge should have a single, unambiguous, authoritative source of representation.

Single source of truth

It goes beyond duplication of code.

Duplication of effort, not just duplication of code.

If we do manual testing, that is a violation of DRY
If we do manual deployment, that is a violation of DRY

Duplication is *not* always a bad thing

Consider and evaluation the trade offs

For example, if we remove duplication we can improve reuse.
But, it also increases coupling and decreases encapsulation.

Should we focus on DRY or focus on reduce coupling?

There are no clear answers to those questions.

Context matters

In monoliths, we want very high DRY, high reuse, we are OK
with increasing coupling to achieve this. We don't have as 
many boundaries to worry about coupling as much.

In microservices, we want high encapsulation, low coupling,
and autonomy of development. In order to place these qualities
higher up, we are willing (or should be willing) to compromise on DRY.

It really comes to trade offs.
