Kent Beck's 4 rules of simple design:
-passes all the tests
-reveals its intentions clearly
-removes duplication
-has fewest elements

he places them in the order of diminimhing priority.

These rules nicely strike a balance.

If we create large functions we will have fewer functions, but
they get hard to test. We will break them into smaller functions.
But having too many smaller functions complicates the system
as well, so we will strive for minimalism. There in lies the balance.
