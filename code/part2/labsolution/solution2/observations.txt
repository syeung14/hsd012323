Original code:
+It works
+tests pass
+the remote is universal, may control different types of devices
+we can have multiple remotes for an instance of a TV, for example

-Remote has tight coupling to different classes
-Remote is not extensible to adding new devices
-too many changes to accommodate new devices controlled by a remote

We are not using DIP

Solutions:
-create an interface RemoteControlled that TV, Fan, etc. implement
-make the Remote as an interface

Keep in mind, design is full of trade offs. There is no right and wrong. There are only better or worse.
